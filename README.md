# ReorderSimulation_GPU

Read [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbEWf1lX-9h8otXMlX9OXkP_hpeAQFf3WwkXRBrK0PE/edit?tab=t.0) document to get an overview while referring back to this repo.

2D Code is in folder GPU_Based_Final

3D Code is in folder GPU_Based_3D

Every single folder in GPU_Based_3D has a README to refer back.

Note: Some of the files containing the trajectory data and fields data are still stored locally because of their size.
