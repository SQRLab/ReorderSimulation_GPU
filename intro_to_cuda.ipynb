    "\n",
    "CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model designed for their GPUs. While GPUs were originally designed for rendering graphics, CUDA allows them to be used for general-purpose computing (GPGPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key aspects of CUDA:\n",
    "* Allows direct access to GPU's virtual instruction set\n",
    "* Enables parallel processing across thousands of GPU cores\n",
    "* Only works with NVIDIA GPUs\n",
    "* Traditionally requires writing code in C/C++\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why GPUs are good for parallel computing:\n",
    "* **CPU vs GPU Architecture**:\n",
    "  * CPUs have few cores (2-64) optimized for sequential tasks\n",
    "  * GPUs have thousands of smaller cores optimized for parallel tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallel Processing Benefits**:\n",
    "  * GPUs excel at tasks where the same operation is performed on large amounts of data\n",
    "  * Common applications:\n",
    "    * Scientific computing\n",
    "    * Machine learning\n",
    "    * Simulation\n",
    "    * Data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NUMBA**\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates Python code into optimized machine code. It's particularly valuable because of the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Makes GPU Programming Accessible\n",
    "* **Python-First Approach**: Write CUDA code in Python instead of C/C++\n",
    "* **Automatic Memory Management**: No manual memory allocation/deallocation needed\n",
    "* **Simple Decorators**: Use `@cuda.jit` to designate GPU-accelerated functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Offers Multiple Compilation Targets\n",
    "* **CPU Optimization**: Use `@jit` for faster CPU execution\n",
    "* **GPU Acceleration**: Use `@cuda.jit` for GPU-based parallel processing\n",
    "* **Parallel CPU**: Use `@vectorize` for CPU-based parallel execution\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Key Features\n",
    "* **NumPy Integration**: \n",
    "  * Seamless compatibility with NumPy arrays\n",
    "  * Direct support for NumPy operations and functions\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Python Subset Support**: \n",
    "  * Works with core Python features\n",
    "  * Supports essential NumPy functionality\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Low-Effort Migration**: \n",
    "  * Minimal code changes needed for GPU acceleration\n",
    "  * Keep existing Python code structure\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Automatic Optimization**: \n",
    "  * Smart optimization of numerical computations\n",
    "  * Efficient loop transformations\n",
    "  * Vectorization of operations where possible    "

    "   - Gets the absolute thread ID in a 1D grid\n",
    "   - Each thread needs to know which array element it's responsible for\n",
    "   - The '1' parameter indicates we're working with a 1D grid\n",

    "   - Critical for preventing out-of-bounds memory access\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - Creates a shared memory array within each thread block\n",
    "   - Size must be a compile-time constant\n",
    "   - Each block gets its own independent copy\n",
    "   - Faster than global memory but limited in size\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Thread Identification**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   idx = cuda.grid(1)          # Global thread ID across all blocks\n",
    "   thread_id = cuda.threadIdx.x  # Local thread ID within current block\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Need both global and local IDs for different purposes\n",
    "   - Global ID (idx) for accessing input/output arrays\n",
    "   - Local ID (thread_id) for accessing shared memory\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thread Synchronization**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   cuda.syncthreads()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Forces all threads in a block to wait at this point\n",
    "   - Critical when using shared memory\n",
    "   - Ensures all threads have finished writing before any start reading\n",
    "   - Only synchronizes threads within the same block\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Access Pattern**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if thread_id > 0 and thread_id < 255:\n",
    "       output_array[idx] = (shared_array[thread_id - 1] + \n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - Shows how threads can access neighbors' data\n",
    "   - Uses bounds checking to handle edge cases\n",
